    <h1 id="title">[DRAFT] Timed Media Working Group Charter</h1>

    <p class="mission">The
    <strong>mission</strong> of the Timed Media Working Group, part of
    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/rwc/">Rich Web Client Activity</a>, is to
    further develop timed media capabilities in the Open Web Platform, including but not limited to video and audio features.</p>

    <p>The Timed Media Working Group will expand upon the basic capabilities provided by HTML5's <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> media elements as well as develop lower level APIs that provide the foundation for featires developed by the Audio Working Group, the WebRTC Working Group, and others.</p>

	  <h3>Success Criteria</h3>

    <p>In order to advance beyond Candidate Recommendation, each specification is expected to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
      
	 <h3>Out of Scope</h3>

   <p>The group will not work on developing codecs or new media formats.</p>
   <p>The group will not work on audio processing APIs or real-time communication but will liaise with the Audio Working Group and the WebRTC Working Group to ensure lower level capabilities
    created by the Timed Media Working Group are compatible with those groups' goals.</p>

    <div>
      <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
      <p>The working group will deliver the following W3C Recommendations:</p>
      

	
	  <p><span class="toadd">Identify which deliverables are
	  expected to become Recommendations and
	  which are expected to become Group Notes.  Identify documents that are
	  expected to become W3C Recommendations but that are (per the
	  <a href="/2004/02/05-pp-transition" shape="rect">transition procedure</a>)
	  not covered by the W3C Patent Policy. Please indicate whether
	  any specification is likely to be
	  a <a href="/Guide/pubrules-about#delta" shape="rect">delta
	  specification</a> intended to become a normative Recommendation.
	  <strong>Note:</strong> Does this group have CPP documents that
	  were CR or PR when the group first transitioned to the W3C
	  Patent Policy (meaning they would still be CPP) but that
	  the group now plans to publish as a Working Draft? If so,
	  please contact the W3C Communications Team for instructions.

    <div class="participation">
      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

      <p>To be successful, the Timed Media Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration, and to have the participation of industry leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it produces.</p> 

      <p>The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute one half-day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants. This Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for building Test Suites for each specification.</p>

      <p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy.</p>

      <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
      <p class="toadd">This section needs to be updated to encourage participation in the GitHub repos.</p>
    	<p>This group primarily conducts its work on the public

            Administrative tasks may be conducted in
    	Member-only communications.
    	</p>
      <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants,

      meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is
      available from the Timed Media Working Group home
      page.</p>

    <div class="decisions">
      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

      <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus" shape="rect">section
      3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there
      is consensus.
      The expectation is that typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required. However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs should put a question out for voting within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available.</p>

      <p>Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is to be considered provisional until 10 working days after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the working groups mailing list. If no objections are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>

      <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes" shape="rect">Section
        3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no
        voting procedures beyond what the Process Document
        requires.</p>
